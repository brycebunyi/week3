	<h2>True Fear of Porcine Actinobacillus Pleuropneumonia</h2>
	<p>Similar to cows, pigs have a small lung volume relative to their body volume. As a result, a great burden is placed on their lungs.
	Therefore, pigs are prone to suffer from respiratory disease. Factors such as stress are complexly involved, and also, in some cases one type of pathogen causes respiratory disease, however in many cases, mixed infection of multiple types of pathogens causes respiratory disease. Therefore, a condition called porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is frequently observed, especially porcine pleuropneumonia (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae; APP) is the disease which causes the greatest damage among PRDC, and the total damage may correspond to approximately 10 billion yen a year. The larger the pigs grow, the more increase in feed expense, sanitation expense, etc. will result. If there is an accident, a great loss of profit will occur.
	Pigpen environment, rearing density, and climatic conditions are closely involved in APP. Especially, climatic conditions are the major factor for APP. In Japan, summer is characterized by high temperature and high humidity, and winter is characterized by low temperature and low humidity. Such climatic conditions are the cause of great damage due to occurrence of APP in Japan. In fact, occurrence of APP has not become a major problem in American and European countries. After visiting pig farms in American and European countries, I too have realized this difference. Next, we would like to briefly review a disease of APP.</p>
	
	<p>Cause: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the causative agent. Because it was originally classified into Haemophilus sp., some pig farmers call this disease "Hemo". Currently, it is classified into serotypes from type 1 to type 15. In Japan, type 2 is the main type, but type 1 and type 5 are sometimes isolated as well. This bacterium produces exotoxins called Apx I, II, and III and shows a high virulence. Currently, vaccines which contain toxoids of this toxin are mainly used.</p>
	
	<p>Symptoms: The course after infection with this bacterium is rapid, and experimentally infected pigs may die in about 10 hours. Symptoms of the acute form include loss of spirit, loss of appetite, increased respiratory rate, fever of 40̊C or above, vomiting, and cyanosis, and such pigs may die suddenly in about 1 to 3 days after the onset. When symptoms have become severe, pigs will take a dog-sitting posture and lie face down (Schematic diagram 1), so that they can be detected easily. However, it is not easy to make a diagnosis based on increased respiratory rate or increased body temperature. When a person goes into the pigpen, pigs may rampage in the pigpen. Symptoms such as increased respiratory rate may be observed, and piglets may have fever above 40̊C.</p>
	
	<p>Nevertheless, because early detection will lead to early treatment, careful observation is extremely important. In the chronic form, on the other hand, coughing and underdevelopment are observed.</p>
	
	<p>Pathological findings: In the acute form, increase in and turbidity of pleural effusion and pericardial effusion as well as hyperemia and bleeding of the lungs are observed (See the schematic diagram 2 on the next page). In the chronic form, fibrinous adhesions of the lungs and pleura (See the schematic diagram 3 on the next page) as well as formation of nodules containing pus in the lungs is sometimes observed.</p>
	
	<p>Countermeasures: Countermeasures consist of prevention by vaccines and treatment by drugs. Vaccines consist mainly of those containing Apx I, II, and III. Drugs such as penicillin injections, feed additives, drinking water additives, and injections made from florfenicol, and feed additives made from doxycycline are being utilized.</p>
